<!--
  Current/unreleased release notes only — this is what `gh release create
  --notes-file RELEASE_NOTES.md` publishes to the GitHub Release page
  when a `v*.*.*` tag is pushed (see .github/workflows/release.yml).

  Process for cutting a release (order matters — tag while this file
  still has real content, archive/reset only after):
    1. Make sure this file describes what's actually shipping.
    2. Move the CHANGELOG.md [Unreleased] section to a new [vX.Y.Z] - date
       heading (add a fresh empty [Unreleased] above it).
    3. Commit, tag (`git tag vX.Y.Z`), push the tag — release.yml reads
       this file exactly as it is in that tagged commit.
    4. Only after tagging: run `scripts/cut-release.sh vX.Y.Z` — archives
       this file's content to docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md and resets it back
       to the template below, in a new commit on main.
  See docs/releases/README.md for the full archive convention.
